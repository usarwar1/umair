<p class="text-justify" > I am an aspiring Mechanical Engineering, currently working towards my PhD at <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/reidlab/">REID Lab</a> at <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/">Purdue Universirty</a> in West Lafayette Indiana. I have completed my Bachelors of Science in Mech E. and Masters of Science in Mech E. from Purdue University as well. </p
<p class="text-justify" > Having completed my Masters and one semester of my PhD., I have experience in defining and executing problem solving skills. Unlike many other PhD's, I am accusomted to working at a fast pace environment due to the various components of interdiscipinary work. I have a wide range of experience working in industry as a Product Design as well as Manufaturing Intern. My research has scoped a wide variety of fields , ranging from Engineering Educartion, Fluid Mechanics to the current field of product design and automation safety using bioimaging techniques.</p>
<p>Working with large amounts of data in signal processing and bio-imaging has sparked an interest in data science and data visualisation. A lot of my time these is spent taking online courses and playing with datasets and honing my skills. </p>
<p>I am always open to different opportunities in industry and research ,ready to face the challenges awaiting. Please feel free to hit me up on Linkedin and I would be happy to connect.</p>
