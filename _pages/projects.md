  <h3>Design</h3>
  <h4>Application of Decision Making Utility Theory</h4>
  <p>Game theoretical modelling was used to model the crowdsourcing competition for a child robot interaction system.With current technology being targetted towards evluating human robot interactions in different envrionemtns, there is an emerging trend towards introducing the new generations growing up to concept of robots. A crowdsourcing contest between two such firms was modelled using Utility Theory and Nash Equilibrium. (<a href="/assets/a.pdf">pdf)</a>
  <h4>Product Design for Cook Biotech</h4>
  <p>Brainstormed possible methods and processes to load a piece of human tissue into a hypodermic needle as part of a class project which extended onto an internship.Developed 5 different prototypes to increase the efficiency and financial gain per product sold as they head to mass production.Invented the “Fish Hook Pull” design which uses a 27G needle with a wire EDM fixture to pull in the tissue .Verified the reliability of the design produced from a consistency standpoint and was able to obtain as high as 96 percent and proved the reliability of the design produced from a significant labor and cost reduction standpoint.</p>
  <h4>Application of First Order Reliability Methods</h4>
  <p>The purpose of the project was to make use of the analytical model provided, as developed by Heinrich and supplemented by data from Zhang, to understand the causes of uncertainty in the fatigue life of soldered joints in the PBGA. Using the derived analytical expression, First Order Reliability Methods were applied to the equation to understand the main variable leading to uncertainty in the measure fatigue life. Owing to the large amount of equations involved with various variables, Matlab’s symbolic toolbox was used to assist with the calculations.(<a href="/assets/pro.pdf">pdf)</a>
  <h4>Educational Software Design</h4>
  <p>Develop a software for operating a physics based Haptic Controller. Conducted market research, interviews, client and customer feedback translation and integration , defined scope of project and developed frameworks and presented model to client.</p>
 
  
  <h3>Controls and Systems</h3>
  
  <h4>Sport Analytics Prototype</h4>
  <p>Developed a sports analytics device to target the third biggest sport market-cricket. High fidelity prototpe was developed which gave metrics into ball contact force , rotation of bat, bat speed and accleration through the stroke. Intel microcontroller along with Bluetooth nano was calibrated to give real time analysis. Signal processing was done using Hibbert and Fourier Transofrm.(<a href="/assets/DTEC.pdf">pdf)</a>.</p>
  <h4>Line Follower</h4>
  <p>An autonomous line follower was developed by using system identification to allow it to go straight and come back.It covered a distance of 150ft in a record 7.7 seconds going around the 'P'. Was awarded 1st place in ME 375 Robotics Competition.</p>
  <h4>Other Projects</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Design a Cooling System for Data Center Cooling</li>
  <li>Slider Crank and Gear Train Analysis for a 2 stroke enginer</li>
  <li>Cam Design and dynamic force analysis for a 2 stroke enginer</li>
  <li>Torsion and Bending force autonmous demonstration</li>
  </ul>
