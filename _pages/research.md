  <h1>Current Projects</h1>
  <p>I am currently working on an NSF funded project on CPS(Coginitive Physical Systems). </p>
  
  <h1>Research Interests</h1>
  <p>My research interests revolve around the field of product design and optimization by making using of bioimaging devices.I am extensively making use of psychophiological sensors(fNIRS,EEG,Shimmer) to study different dimension of product design by understanding human phsiology rather than behavioral data. Current research is making use of multi modality of EEG and fNIR's to understand human decisions and needs by geeting the best temporal and spatial resolution. My work and interests revolve around using this multimodality to optimize and improve the driving algorithm in autonmous cars by understanding any underlying physiology affecting the decisions.I hope to use semi-supervised learning to classify the physioloy and implement it in self driving algorithms</p>
